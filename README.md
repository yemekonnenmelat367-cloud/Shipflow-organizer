# ShipFlow Organizer™️
A lightweight warehouse organization framework to reduce staging chaos, walking waste, and CPT risk — *without replacing existing systems*.
## What is ShipFlow Organizer™️?
ShipFlow Organizer™️ is a *downloadable operational framework* that helps warehouses physically organize:
- ⁠Shipment codes
- ⁠Lanes
- ⁠Staging areas
- ⁠Cart flow
Most warehouses already know *where* carts are in the system.  
The real problem is *how they are physically arranged*.
ShipFlow fixes that.
## The problem
Warehouses today experience:
•⁠  ⁠Shipment codes scattered across many staging areas
•⁠  ⁠Long walking distances to retrieve carts
•⁠  ⁠Relocation roles (WebTO / waterspider) becoming bottlenecks
•⁠  ⁠CPT pressure caused by disorganization, not system failure
Existing systems work — *physical flow does not*.
## The solution
ShipFlow Organizer™️ introduces a *simple structure*:
•⁠  ⁠Each lane owns *2–3 shipment codes*
•⁠  ⁠Staging areas are *mapped*, not random
•⁠  ⁠Same-code carts stay physically close
•⁠  ⁠Relocation enforces structure instead of reacting to CPT
No automation.  
No new software.  
No system replacement.
## Who this is for
•⁠  ⁠Ship Dock teams
•⁠  ⁠DCM / TDR operators
•⁠  ⁠Waterspiders / WebTO roles
•⁠  ⁠Operations managers
•⁠  ⁠Any warehouse with multiple CPT deadlines and staging areas
## What’s included
•⁠  ⁠Lane–Code Matrix template
•⁠  ⁠Staging Area Map template
•⁠  ⁠CPT Priority Board
•⁠  ⁠Relocation Control sheet
•⁠  ⁠Real-world examples
All templates work in:
•⁠  ⁠Excel
•⁠  ⁠Google Sheets
•⁠  ⁠LibreOffice
## Getting started (10 minutes)
1.⁠ ⁠Download the templates
2.⁠ ⁠Assign shipment codes to lanes
3.⁠ ⁠Map staging areas to lane groups
4.⁠ ⁠Brief WebTO / DCM roles
5.⁠ ⁠Run one shift and observe improvements
