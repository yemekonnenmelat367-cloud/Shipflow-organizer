# ShipFlow Organizer™️ — Credibility & What This Is Not
## Why This Works
ShipFlow Organizer™️ focuses on *physical warehouse organization*, not digital systems.
•⁠  ⁠Designed from real-world warehouse operations
•⁠  ⁠Tested principles for lane assignment, staging, and relocation
•⁠  ⁠Improves CPT performance without automation
•⁠  ⁠Reduces walking and wasted time
## What ShipFlow Does NOT Replace
•⁠  ⁠Existing warehouse CPT tracking systems
•⁠  ⁠Scanners or digital order systems
•⁠  ⁠Yard or dock management software
•⁠  ⁠Staffing or labor allocation policies
ShipFlow complements your system — it does not replace it.
## Notes for Teams
•⁠  ⁠Follow lane assignments and staging rules strictly
•⁠  ⁠Only relocate carts when approved and logged
•⁠  ⁠Observe results for continuous improvement
